# Project Title: House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description:

This project aims to develop a robust and accurate model for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The project leverages a historical housing dataset containing features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and amenities. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The primary goal is to build a model that can reliably estimate house prices based on given features, aiding potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Key Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing : Collects historical housing data, cleaning, transforming, and preparing it for model training.

Feature Engineering : Identifies and selects relevant features. Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables were performed.

Model Selection :  Employs Linear Regression algorithm, as it's well-suited for predicting continuous values.

Model Training and Evaluation : Trains the model using the training data and evaluates its performance using metrics such as R-squared score, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error.

Hyperparameter Tuning : Optimizes model performance using GridSearchCV with Lasso regularization to fine-tune hyperparameters.

Feature Importance Analysis : Identifies the most influential features impacting house price predictions, using methods like SelectKBest.

Conclusion : The project successfully developed a house price prediction model achieving an R-squared score of 0.65. Feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques played a crucial role in improving prediction accuracy. This model can serve as a valuable tool for stakeholders in the real estate market.
